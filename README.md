# imgfliper-csharp
A simple c# library for interacting with the REST API endpoint of ImgFlip to make memes

Fork of https://github.com/gfmatthews/imgfliper-csharp meant for .net core solutions.

Usage of both wrappers (ImfFlipAPI.APISource.Core and ImgFlipAPI.APISource) is the same, main difference are in namespaces.
